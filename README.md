# Description

Write a program in the language of your choosing that:

 * Consumes both `rotations.csv` and `spots.csv`
 * Generates output that shows cost per view by two dimensions:
   * CPV by creative
   * CPV by rotation by day

### Details

First, this is intentionally a little underspecified.  Feel free to
ask questions, or to just make assumptions.  If you *do* make any
assumptions for the sake of expediency, document 'em so we know you
considered them!

For the purpose of this exercise, here's some terminology:

 * "Creative" - Business lingo for a TV ad
 * "Rotation" - The timerange on a TV network that an ad airs in
