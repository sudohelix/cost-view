# Tatari Hiring Homework

This is a quick little homework assignment that we give to our potential
hires.  It's mostly intended to just make sure that people can actually
write code, but also serves as a decent indicator to how they think about
data and write code to make use of data.

## Timeboxing

We want to be respectful of your time, and the fact of the matter is
that this is essentially throwaway code, so any work on this should be
timeboxed to an hour or two, tops.  If it's not "finished," that's fine;
seeing in-progress code is just as enlightening!

## Description

Write a program in the language of your choosing that:

 * Consumes both `rotations.csv` and `spots.csv`
 * Generates output that shows cost per view by two dimensions:
   * CPV by creative
   * CPV by rotation by day

**No Jupyter notebooks, please!**  We love them here and use them ourselves
at times, but this assignment is about seeing how you write *programs*, and
*not* about how you do data analysis.  Show us your best software, not your
best matplotlib formatting.

### Details

First, this is intentionally a little underspecified.  Feel free to
ask questions, or to just make assumptions.  If you *do* make any
assumptions for the sake of expediency, document 'em so we know you
considered them!

For the purpose of this exercise, here's some terminology:

 * "Creative" - Business lingo for a TV ad
 * "Rotation" - The timerange on a TV network that an ad airs in
